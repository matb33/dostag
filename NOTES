Would it be more efficient to modify the pub-sub arrangement for layers to only send down what is within the current player's viewport? I foresee the problem with this as being whenever you move, the subscription would have to be reset each time. What happens then? Does the entire data within viewport get re-sent, even though we used to know most of it before moving?
