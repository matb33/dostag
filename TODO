TODO:
 ☐ allow user to load a new map via URL
 ☐ allow user to see other actively loaded maps on same server, and switch
 ☐ make the default map much bigger and more interesting
 ✔ allow chat bubbles @done (13-02-07 22:13)
 ✔ optimize networking, specifically whenever we attack, position data really lags badly @done (13-02-09 17:26)
 ✔ measure data going over-the-wire for various layers. Is the [y + "_" + x] strategy working? Should we revert back to [y][x]? Or perhaps we even flatten it further and put it right in the root of the document, like ["layername_" + y + "_" + "x"] @done (13-02-09 14:38)
 ✔ consider renaming Sprites module to Sprite, to match all other modules @done (13-02-09 14:38)
 ✔ convert to Activity collection instead of rendering weapons in map layer @done (13-02-09 14:38)
 ✔ perhaps show basic controls somewhere, off the dos box @done (13-02-10 16:48)
 ✔ setup being able to kill another player @done (13-02-10 16:48)
 ✔ have bombs limited and resupply at a given rate @done (13-02-10 16:48)
 ✔ implement a stat bar in a corner that shows: @done (13-02-11 14:28)
   ✔ remaining bombs @done (13-02-10 16:48)
   ✔ # of players @done (13-02-10 16:48)

MAYBE:
 ☐ setup the game to be in "rounds", where you can't just join a game mid-way, you have to wait until someone wins to join the match (observe mode)
 ☐ as soon as there is more than one player in a map, the round begins
 ☐ implement an intro screen that shows instructions, possibly allowing you to change your username
 ☐ consider abstracting Meteor.users in Player module
 ☐ not a huge deal, but it would be nice if the chat bubbles followed the player as he moved
 ☐ consider moving the Movement stuff to an Activity
