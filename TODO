TODO:
 ☐ implement an intro screen that shows instructions, possibly allowing you to change your username
 ☐ implement a stat bar in a corner that shows:
   ☐ remaining bombs
   ☐ # of players
   ☐ ping?
 ☐ have bombs limited and resupply at a given rate
 ☐ allow user to load a new map via URL
 ☐ allow user to see other actively loaded maps on same server, and switch
 ☐ setup the game to be in "rounds", where you can't just join a game mid-way, you have to wait until someone wins to join the match (observe mode)
 ☐ as soon as there is more than one player in a map, the round begins
 ☐ perhaps show basic controls somewhere, off the dos box
 ☐ setup being able to kill another player
 ☐ have the new round event perform the reset on the map, where map content is re-exported to grid format
 ☐ make the default map much bigger and more interesting
 ☐ consider abstracting Meteor.users in Player module
 ☐ not a huge deal, but it would be nice if the chat bubbles following the player as he moved
 ✔ allow chat bubbles @done (13-02-07 22:13)
 ✔ optimize networking, specifically whenever we attack, position data really lags badly @done (13-02-09 17:26)
 ✔ measure data going over-the-wire for various layers. Is the [y + "_" + x] strategy working? Should we revert back to [y][x]? Or perhaps we even flatten it further and put it right in the root of the document, like ["layername_" + y + "_" + "x"] @done (13-02-09 14:38)
 ✔ consider renaming Sprites module to Sprite, to match all other modules @done (13-02-09 14:38)
 ✔ convert to Activity collection instead of rendering weapons in map layer @done (13-02-09 14:38)


LONG TERM:
 ☐ consider an instance system, possibly with a separate server-browser Meteor app that can see the various game servers? dostag.meteor.com would see dostag01.meteor.com, dostag02.meteor.com, etc
